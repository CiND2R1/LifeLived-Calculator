# Life-Lived-Calculator

A simple Python program that lets users calculate how long they've lived based on their birth date â€” in years, months, weeks, days, hours, or even seconds!

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- User-friendly command-line input.
- Validates input dates to avoid errors.
- Supports multiple time units: `year`, `month`, `week`, `day`, `hour`, `second`.
- Approximates months (30 days) and years (365 days) for simple estimation.

## ðŸ§  How It Works

1. The user is prompted to enter their birth date.
2. The program calculates the difference between the current date and the birth date.
3. The user chooses a time unit to see how long they've lived.
4. The result is printed in the selected unit.

## ðŸ“¦ Requirements

- Python 3.x

No external libraries are needed â€” just the built-in `datetime` module.

## ðŸš€ Usage

```bash
$ python life_lived_core.py
